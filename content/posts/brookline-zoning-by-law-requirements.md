Brookline must designate a land area of at least 41 acres that allow multi-family housing by right, known as its "multi-family zoning district". The district must have a theoretical [capacity]( {{< ref capacity-use >}} ) of 6,990 units of housing.

At least 50% of the district must be comprised of contiguous parcels. No part of the district that is less than 5 contiguous acres can count toward the 41 acre minimum size requirement.

90% of the district must be within 0.5 miles of an MBTA subway station, commuter rail station, ferry terminal or bus station.
