The current zoning by-law has no meaningful parameters for parking, such as where it is located.

The following design guidelines can be added to our zoning by-law using form-based codes:

- No parking along the front of a parcel
- No curb cuts on Harvard St (eats up parking and pedestrian safety)
- No parking entrance visible within 50% of the front of a parcel

Implementing these guidelines in our zoning would make streets safer for pedestrians and support commercial activity.
