The current zoning by-laws have no meaningful parameters for parking, such as where it is located.

If we want design guidelines built into our zoning that are conducive to successful retail, active ground floor design guidelines could include:

- No parking along the front of a lot
- No curb cuts on Harvard St (eats up parking and pedestrian safety)
- No parking entrance visible within 50% of the front of the lot.

Implementing these guidelines in our zoning would make streets more walkable and support commercial activity.
