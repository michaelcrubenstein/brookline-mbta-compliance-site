Abutters worry about additional traffic caused by loading and unloading. This worry can be addressed by curb control: as projects are reviewed and permitted by the planning department, they can require loading zones for those projects. Then the developer to pay for the installation of the zone. Also, the Department of Public Works can prioritize locating loading zones as part of its strategic planning.
