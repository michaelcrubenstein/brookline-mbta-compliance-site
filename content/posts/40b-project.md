A 40B project is a building that is permitted to be built according to Chapter [40B](/posts/40b) of the Massachusetts General Laws.

Chapter 40B projects are limited in how profitable they can be. However, 40B buildings can compensate for those limits by being larger than projects that follow local zoning laws.
