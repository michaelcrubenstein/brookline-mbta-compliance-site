Brookline needs housing that is affordable for people earning a variety of income levels, including "workforce" housing.

The MBTA-CA Consensus Warrant Article includes a ground floor commercial incentive to give financial relief to developers who fund the build-out of ground floor commercial space in their buildings.

The incentive allows a developer to charge more for the building’s required affordable housing units if they build out the ground floor for a commercial tenant. This tradeoff avoids a major up-front cost for a small business seeking to occupy the ground floor, while keeping the apartments affordable at a “workforce” level.

By accepting the incentive, a developer can charge rent that is affordable for a person who earns up to 70% of the Area Median Income (AMI) instead of 50% of AMI. If the housing unit is an affordable condo, it can be sold for a price affordable for a person who earns up to 100% of AMI instead of 80%. 

This incentive was reviewed and approved by the {{< rawhtml >}}<a href="https://www.brooklinema.gov/493/Economic-Development-Advisory-Board" target="_new">Economic Development Advisory Board</a>{{< /rawhtml >}} (EDAB) and the {{< rawhtml >}}<a href="https://www.brooklinema.gov/473/Housing-Advisory-Board" target="_new">Housing Advisory Board</a>{{< /rawhtml >}} (HAB).
