Compliance with the MBTA-CA requires changes to zoning. It is not a housing production plan, so it doesn't automatically create any housing, affordable or not.

Brookline has a requirement town-wide that at least 15% of multi-family housing with more than 10 units must be affordable. Any housing created in the multi-family zoning district must comply with requirement, approved by the 2023 Annual Town Meeting.

However, the Select Board has established [housing goals for the town]( {{< ref goals-of-the-town >}} ) apart from MBTA-CA requirements. Those include having enough capacity so that an additional 699 units of housing could be built as a result of changes to our zoning by-laws.
