Compliance with the MBTA-CA requires changes to zoning. It is not a housing production plan, so it doesn't automatically create any housing, affordable or not.

Since [Warrant Article 14](/posts/warrant-article-14) passed, Brookline has a requirement town-wide that multi-family housing with more than 10 units will have to have 15% of their units deed affordable. Any housing created in the multi-family zoning district will have to comply with this zoning by-law.

The Select Board has established [goals for the town](/posts/goals-of-the-town) for our MBTA compliance that include that there will be at least 699 units of housing likely to be built in the multi-family zoning district.
