Inclusionary zoning by-laws require developers to either include affordable units in their buildings or pay into a trust that develops affordable housing.

Payments made for inclusionary zoning go to the Affordable Housing Trust Fund.

As a result of a recent amendment to Brookline's inclusionary zoning by-laws, passed at Town Meeting in May 2023, buildings with at least 11 housing units must include affordable housing on site. 

According to state law, Brookline can't require more than 10% of units for a building be affordable for residents at 80% of the area median income (AMI). However, by documenting its economic feasibility of stricter inclusionary zoning town-wide, we can require stricter inclusionary zoning: 15% of units for a building must be affordable for residents at 50% AMI. As of May 2023, we are in the process of documenting such economic feasibility.
