According to the current Brookline zoning by-law, most multi-family housing projects require a [special permit]( {{< ref special-permit >}} ). Applying for a special permit gives the town the opportunity to disallow projects that are not deemed appropriate for their neighborhood or modify projects as a condition of getting a special permit. However, requiring a special permit is specifically prohibited for building multi-family housing within an MBTA-CA compliant zoning district.

Form-based zoning codes are specific, measurable and defensible. Under form-based zoning codes, building projects will have to meet predictable characteristics of their neighborhoods and their surroundings regardless of not needing to apply for a special permit.
