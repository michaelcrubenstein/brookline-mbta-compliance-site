Form-based zoning by-laws are specific, measurable and defensible. With form-based zoning, we will have predictable building projects that meet the characteristics of their neighborhoods without needing to require a [special permit](/posts/special-permit).

There are several [categories](/posts/form-based-zoning-categories) of form-based zoning.

By contrast, our current zoning by-laws use [conventional zoning](/posts/form-based-vs-conventional-zoning).
