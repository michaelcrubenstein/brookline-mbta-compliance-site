The town is proceeding in two ways:
1. The Planning department is developing a zoning update for Harvard Street.
2. The Select Board has charged the {{< rawhtml >}}<a href="https://www.brooklinema.gov/3608/MBTA-CA-Multifamily-Permitting-Committee" target="_new">MBTA-CA Multifamily Permitting Committee</a>{{< /rawhtml >}} with exploring other options.

The {{< rawhtml >}}<a href="https://www.brooklinema.gov/2044/Multifamily-MBTA" target="_new">Planning Department's web page</a>{{< /rawhtml >}} devoted to this project answers this question in detail.

As directed by the Select Board on August 15, the Brookline Planning Department has drafted two warrant articles, the Consensus Warrant Article and the Backup Warrant Article that reflect the work above. These two articles are included in the Warrant for the Fall Town Meeting, starting November 14, 2023.
