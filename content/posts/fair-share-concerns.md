Compliance with the MBTA-CA Guidelines uses a theoretical capacity to determine the minimum number of units in a compliant zoning district. This theoretical capacity is calculcated as if each parcel of land has no building on it. 

Since Brooklineâ€™s compliant zoning district is more likely to have buildings in it already, the burden to build additional housing on Brookline could actually be relatively lower than other, less dense communities.
