Compliance with the MBTA-CA Guidelines uses a theoretical [capacity]( {{< ref capacity-use >}} ) to determine the minimum number of units in a compliant zoning district. Theoretical capacity is calculcated as if each parcel has no buildings on it. 

Since Brooklineâ€™s compliant zoning district is more likely to have buildings in it already, the burden on Brookline to build additional housing could actually be relatively lower than other, less dense communities.
