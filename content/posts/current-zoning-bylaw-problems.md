1. Our current zoning code routinely uses Floor-area-ratio (FAR) to determine the maximum size of a building on a lot. However, determining the allowable size of buildings using FAR to determine the size of a building doesn't produce predictable shape or mass of that building. 
2. The extensive use of [special permits]( {{< ref special-permit >}} )  as workarounds to other flaws in our zoning code makes developing housing more expensive. The permitting process takes longer, more expertise is required, and the outcomes are more arbitrary.
