Could this be done in time to include those areas in the alternative plan being developed by the Select Board Multifamily Planning Committee?

Those are deeper lots with different parameters for the footprints. Especially with Beacon St., 

Can re-use the experience, but not the particular results. For example...

Standards for areas in the front yard at St. Mary's.
What about fore-courts (need zoning for that)
Haven't studied the adjacency there. Also grade changes.
