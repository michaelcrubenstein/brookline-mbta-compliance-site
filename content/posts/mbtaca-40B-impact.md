Under our current zoning by-law, the planning department projects that Brookline will fall below the 10% threshold that allows the town to reject 40B applications in September 2023.

Under the Harvard Street Zoning Proposal, any new developments on Harvard Street would be four story projects with 15% affordable units. This would increase both the numerator and the denominator of the ratio used to determine if we have sufficient affordable housing to  reject [Chapter 40B]( {{< ref 40b >}} ) applications.
