Under our current zoning by-law, the planning department projects that Brookline will fall below the 10% threshold that allows the town to reject 40B applications in September 2023. Regardless of how Brookline complies with the MBTA-CA, Brookline will continue to periodically fall below this threshold without new housing of which more than 10% is affordable.

Under the Harvard Street zoning proposal, many new developments on Harvard Street are anticipated to be four story buildings with more than ten units and 15% affordable units (pending [EOHLC]( {{< ref eohlc >}} ) approval of Brookline's affordable housing parameters). This would increase both the numerator and the denominator of the ratio used to determine if we have sufficient affordable housing to reject [Chapter 40B]( {{< ref 40b >}} ) applications.
