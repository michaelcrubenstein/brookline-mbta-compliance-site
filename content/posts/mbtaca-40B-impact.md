With our current zoning by-laws, the planning department projects that Brookline will fall below the 10% threshold for being able to reject 40B applications in September, 2023.

By implementing the Harvard Street Study, new developments on Harvard St will all be four story projects with 15% affordable units. This increases both the Numerator and the Denominator of the ratio used to determine if we have enough affordable housing to be able to reject [Chapter 40B]( {{< ref 40b >}} )  applications.
