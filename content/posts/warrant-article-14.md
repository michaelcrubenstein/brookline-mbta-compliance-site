Warrant Article 14  from the Spring 2023 Town Meeting lowers the number of units that can be contained in a building before the building is required to contain affordable housing units on site. The previous limit was 19 units and the limit in warrant article 14 is 10 units.

Warrant Article 14 passed Town Meeting, so all developments with at least 11 units are now required by Brookline's by-law to have 15% of the units on site be affordable.
