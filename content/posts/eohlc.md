The Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities is a cabinet level office that is charged with creating more homes in Massachusetts and lowering  housing costs for residents. It was previously known as the Department of Housing and Community Development.

EOHLC enforces the MBTA-Communities Act by reviewing the plans from MBTA communities and determines whether those plans are in compliance with the MBTA-CA.

EOHLC has developed guidelines that specify what cities and towns need to do to comply with the MBTA-CA.
