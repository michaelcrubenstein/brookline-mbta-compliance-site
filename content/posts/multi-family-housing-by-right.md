The [MBTA Community Act (MBTA-CA)]( {{< ref mbta-community-act >}} ) and 
[EOHLC Guidelines]( {{< ref eohlc-multi-family-housing-guidelines >}} ) require that all 
lots within a specified multi-family zoning district are [permitted]( {{< ref permitting-by-right >}} ) 
to build [multi-family housing]( {{< ref multi-family-housing >}} ) [by right]( {{< ref permitting-by-right >}} ). 
Requiring a [special permit]( {{< ref special-permit >}} ) for any reason is prohibited.

Risks of poorly specifying a multi-family zoning district include:
1. Ground floor shops, such as those in Coolidge Corner, might be replaced by expensive condos that are more profitable to build.
2. Buildings might not meet aesthetic, size, safety, environmental or other standards of their neighborhoods.
