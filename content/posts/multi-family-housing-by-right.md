The [MBTA Community Act (MBTA-CA)](/posts/the-law/mbta-community-act) and [DHCD Guidelines](/posts/dhcd-multi-family-housing-guidelines) require that all lots within a specified multi-family zoning district are [permitted](/posts/permitting-by-right) to build [multi-family housing](/posts/the-law/multi-family-housing) [by right](/posts/permitting-by-right). Requiring a [special permit](/posts/special-permit) for any reason is prohibited.

Risks of poorly specifying a multi-family zoning district include:
1. Ground floor shops, such as those in Coolidge Corner, might be replaced by expensive condos that are more profitable to build.
2. Buildings might not meet aesthetic, size, safety, environmental or other standards of their neighborhoods.
