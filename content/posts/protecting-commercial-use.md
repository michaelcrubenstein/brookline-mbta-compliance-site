1. By specifying [form-based codes]( {{< ref form-based-zoning-categories >}} ) in our zoning by-law, we can constrain the buildings that are multi-family [as of right]( {{< ref permitting-by-right >}} ) to dramatically favor the maintenance and creation of first-floor retail. For example, making the first floor at ground level and have its frontage be 80% transparent.
2. The MBTA-CA Consensus Warrant Article contains an incentive to provide [developer relief for commercial retail]( {{< ref developer-relief-for-commercial-retail >}} ).
3. By increasing the residential population that is proximate to Coolidge Corner, we can better support the commercial activity there.

Integrating commercial uses with other uses is one of the principles of a [15-minute community]( {{< ref 15-minute-communities >}} ).
