1. Form-based zoning can help us [comply](/posts/advantages-of-form-based-zoning) with the MBTA-CA. By specifying [form-based zoning](/posts/form-based-zoning-categories) by-laws, we can constrain the buildings that are multi-family [as of right](/posts/permitting-by-right) to dramatically favor the maintenance and creation of first-floor retail. For example, making the first floor at ground level and have its frontage be 80% transparent.
2. The Economic Development Advisory Board and the Housing Advisory Board are working on a proposal to provide [developer relief for commercial retail](developer-relief-for-commercial-retail.md).
3. By increasing the residential population that is proximate to Coolidge Corner, we can better support the commercial activity there.

[Integrating commercial uses with other uses is one of the principles of a [15-minute community](/posts/15-minute-communities).
