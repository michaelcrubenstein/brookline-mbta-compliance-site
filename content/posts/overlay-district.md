An overlay district is an area of land with zoning that can override the zoning otherwise required of the lots ("the base zoning") contained within the overlay district. 

For example, if the base zoning of a certain type of district says that buildings cannot be taller than 45 feet, then overlay district zoning can allow buildings as tall as 55 feet within the overlay district.
