An overlay district is an area of land that has zoning that can override the base zoning of the lots contained within the overlay district. 

For example, if the base zoning of a certain type of district says that buildings cannot be taller than 45 feet, then overlay district  zoning can allow buildings as tall as 55 feet within the overlay district.
