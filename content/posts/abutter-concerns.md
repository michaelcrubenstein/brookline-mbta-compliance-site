### Form-based Zoning
[Form-based zoning]( {{< ref form-based-zoning-categories >}} ) can require or prohibit specific elements of buildings that are out of character with a neighborhood or impinge on abutting neighborhoods. For example, concerns about sky-view would be addressed by step-backs on the top floor. The step-backs could be different for areas that abut single-family, 2-family or 3-family zones.

### Process
Without a special permit, the zoning by-laws can nonetheless specify that projects be subjected to a planning review by the planning board. The planning board doesn't have the authority to reject a project, but can hold a public hearing and engage with the owners of a project on any concerns of the planning board or the public.

### Curb Control

Abutters worry about additional traffic caused by loading and unloading. This worry can be addressed by curb control: as projects are reviewed and permitted by the planning department, they can require loading zones for those projects. Then the developer to pay for the installation of the zone. Also, the Department of Public Works can prioritize locating loading zones as part of its strategic planning.
