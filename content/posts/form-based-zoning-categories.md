Form-based zoning can encompass many different types of requirements that are built into zoning by-laws. The common theme of form-based zoning is that all of the requirements are objective and measurable, not subjective.

Limitations specified in form-based zoning can be relaxed for specific areas by creating an [overlay district](/posts/overlay-district).

### Schematic Massing
By-laws that ensure that the mass of a building is in scale with other buildings in its neighborhood.

- Maximum building heights
- Minimum or maximum floor heights
- Step-backs from one floor to the next
- Set-backs from the edge of lots

### Character/architectural Style
By-laws that ensure that the character and style of a building are coherent with other buildings in its neighborhood.

For example, the following could be implemented in areas where we want ground-floor retail:

- Require 80% transparency of the first floor
- Require prominent cornices
- Quality materials on the ground floor

### Quality of Life Impact
By-laws that ensure that a building is used in such a way that minimizes the disruption to neighbors, maximizes safety and  maintains or improves the quality of life for the surrounding community

- Prohibit parking from view from the public way
- Standards for trash management in the zoning.
- Requiring transparent building corners  so you can see around them.
- Requiring residential entrances on side streets.

### Environmental
By-laws that ensure that a building and its surrounding protect the environment of the building. 

For example, creating a Tree By-law for North Brookline.
