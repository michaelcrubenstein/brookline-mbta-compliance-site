Form-based zoning can encompass many different types of requirements that are built into zoning by-laws. The common theme of form-based zoning codes is that all of the requirements are objective and measurable, not subjective.

Limitations specified in form-based codes can be relaxed for specific areas by creating an [overlay district]( {{< ref overlay-district >}} ).

### Schematic Massing
Codes that ensure that the mass of a building is in scale with other buildings in its neighborhood.

- Maximum building heights
- Minimum or maximum floor heights
- Step-backs from one floor to the next
- Set-backs from the edge of lots

### Character/architectural Style
Codes that ensure that the character and style of a building are coherent with other buildings in its neighborhood.

For example, the following could be implemented in areas where we want ground-floor retail:

- Require 80% transparency of the first floor
- Require prominent cornices
- Quality materials on the ground floor

### Quality of Life Impact
Codes that ensure that a building is used in such a way that minimizes the disruption to neighbors, maximizes safety and  maintains or improves the quality of life for the surrounding community

- Prohibit parking from view from the public way
- Standards for trash management.
- Require transparent building corners so you can see around them.
- Require residential entrances on side streets.
