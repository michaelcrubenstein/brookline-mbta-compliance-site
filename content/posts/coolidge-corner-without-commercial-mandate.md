Studies of Harvard Street have confirmed that, for building owners, ground floor retail is the best use of most parcels along Harvard Street, because owners can get the most dollars per square foot through a commercial lease.

Even without a mandate for ground-floor commercial use, we can [incentivize ground floor retail]( {{< ref protecting-commercial-use >}} ) so strongly that it won't be economically reasonable for property owners to eliminate existing ground-floor retail.
