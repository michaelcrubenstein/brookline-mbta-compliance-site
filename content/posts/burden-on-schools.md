Here is a short model to address this question:

{{< rawhtml >}}<a href="https://data.census.gov/profile/Brookline_town,_Norfolk_County,_Massachusetts?g=060XX00US2502109175" target="_new">2020 Brookline Population</a>{{< /rawhtml >}}: 63,171
{{< rawhtml >}}<br><a href="https://data.census.gov/profile/Brookline_town,_Norfolk_County,_Massachusetts?g=060XX00US2502109175" target="_new">2021 Brookline Total Households</a>{{< /rawhtml >}}: 26,762

Average population per household (26,762/63,171): 2.38 
{{< rawhtml >}}<br>{{< /rawhtml >}}Proposed number of new units on Harvard St.: 800
{{< rawhtml >}}<br>{{< /rawhtml >}}Proposed new population of Harvard St. (800 * 2.38): 1904

{{< rawhtml >}}<a href="https://profiles.doe.mass.edu/statereport/classsizebyraceethnicity.aspx" target="_new">2022-2023 Population of students</a>{{< /rawhtml >}}: 7074
{{< rawhtml >}}<br>{{< /rawhtml >}}% of population as public school students (7074/63,171): 11.2%

Assuming the new population on Harvard St mirrors the overall population...
{{< rawhtml >}}<br>{{< /rawhtml >}}Number of new public school students on Harvard St.: 213

Spread out over 10 years, that is an average growth of 21 students per year, which isn't a large number, especially compared to the 7902 students in the 2018-2019 school year, a recent peak. Even if this model is off by 100%, the number of public school students is approximately half the difference between the peak in 2018-2019 and the current population.
