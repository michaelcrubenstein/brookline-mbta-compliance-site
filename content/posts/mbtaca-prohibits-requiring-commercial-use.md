If a zoning by-law requires commercial use in any part of a building, that building becomes a multi-use building, not a multi-family building. The [MBTA Community Act (MBTA-CA)](mbta-community-act.md) requires that all lots within a compliant multi-family zoning district are [permitted]( {{< ref permitting-by-right) to build [multi-family housing by right]( {{< ref multi-family-housing-by-right >}}  >}} )  . To **require** commercial use on a parcel makes the parcel non-compliant with the MBTA-CA.

A zoning by-law can **allow** multi-use buildings as well as multi-family buildings and be compliant; the by-law cannot **require** multi-use or commercial buildings.
