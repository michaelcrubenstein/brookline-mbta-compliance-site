If a zoning by-law requires commercial use in any part of a building, that building becomes a multi-use building, not a multi-family building. Because the [MBTA Community Act (MBTA-CA)](/posts/the-law/mbta-community-act) requires that all lots within a compliant multi-family zoning district are [permitted](/posts/permitting-by-right) to build [multi-family housing by right](/posts/multi-family-housing-by-right), this requirement makes the area being zoned non-compliant with the MBTA.

A zoning by-law can **allow** multi-use buildings as well as multi-family buildings and be compliant; the by-law cannot **require** multi-use or commercial building.
