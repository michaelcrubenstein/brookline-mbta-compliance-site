According to studies of Harvard Street, the best economic use of the ground floor will be commercial, because owners can get higher rents from commercial leases than residential leases. According to the Harvard Street zoning proposal, new buildings could be four stories high, and, according to Brookline's [inclusionary zoning]( {{< ref inclusionary-zoning >}} ) by-law, 15% of the units must be deemed affordable to lower income people.

In addition, the {{< rawhtml >}}<a href="https://www.brooklinema.gov/493/Economic-Development-Advisory-Board" target="_new">Economic Development Advisory Board</a>{{< /rawhtml >}} (EDAB) and the {{< rawhtml >}}<a href="https://www.brooklinema.gov/473/Housing-Advisory-Board" target="_new">Housing Advisory Board</a>{{< /rawhtml >}} (HAB) are working on a proposal to give financial relief to developers who include commercial retail in their buildings. The proposal was laid out at an EDAB meeting on {{< rawhtml >}}<a href="https://www.brooklinema.gov/DocumentCenter/View/41475/EDAB-0508-2023" target="_new">May 8, 2023</a>{{< /rawhtml >}} and approved at a HAB meeting on June 7, 2023. The proposal was also approved by  EDAB on June 20, 2023.

According to this proposal, if a developer provides evidence of permanent and physical investment in ground floor commercial, then they could relax affordable housing requirements, such as reducing a contribution to the Affordable Housing Trust Fund or raising the maximum income that people coule earn to qualify for affordable units.
