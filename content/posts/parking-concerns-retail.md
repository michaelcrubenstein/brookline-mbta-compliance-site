Brookline has an overnight parking ban. Because of the ban, Brookline residents cannot use on-street parking to store cars that are not in use. Instead, residents who choose to own cars must accommodate their cars within their buildings or through other private arrangements. Thus, the overnight parking ban protects on-street parking for retail business customers. 

Increasing the number of residents nearby provides retail businesses with new customers without reducing their out-of-town or across-town customer base.
