The [EOHLC]( {{< ref eohlc >}} ) has published guidelines that describe how cities and towns must comply with the [MBTA-CA]( {{< ref mbta-communities-act >}} ).

For example, there are guidelines for {{< rawhtml >}}<a target="_new" href="
https://www.mass.gov/info-details/section-3a-guidelines#4.-allowing-multi-family-housing-“as-of-right”-">allowing multi-family housing "as of right"</a>{{< /rawhtml >}}

These guidelines were revised on August 17, 2023 to allow mixed-use development zoning districts to fulfill up to 25% of the required unit capacity for a city or town's multi-family zoning district. In Brookline's case, its required unit capacity of 6,990  could include up to 1,748 units of capacity in a mixed-use development zoning district.

A mixed-use development zoning district must allow mixed-use development [as of right]( {{< ref permitting-by-right >}} ).
