The [EOHLC](eohlc) has published guidelines that describe how cities and towns must comply with the [MBTA-CA](mbta-community-act.md).

For example, there are guidelines for {{< rawhtml >}}<a target="_new" href="
https://www.mass.gov/info-details/section-3a-guidelines#4.-allowing-multi-family-housing-“as-of-right”-">allowing multi-family housing "as of right"</a>{{< /rawhtml >}}

The following are examples of requirements that would be deemed to be inconsistent with “[as of right](/posts/permitting-by-right)” use: ...; and (iii) a requirement that multi-family use must be combined with commercial or other uses on the same lot or as part of a single project.  Mixed use projects may be allowed as of right in a multi-family zoning district, as long as multi-family housing is separately allowed as of right.
