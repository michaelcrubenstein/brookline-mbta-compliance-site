### Form-based Zoning
[Form-based zoning](/posts/form-based-zoning-categories) can require or prohibit specific elements of buildings that are out of character with a neighborhood or impinge on abutting neighborhoods. For example, concerns about sky-view would be addressed by step-backs on the top floor. The step-backs could be different for areas that abut single-family, 2-family or 3-family zones.

### Process
Without a special permit, the zoning by-laws can nonetheless specify that projects be subjected to a planning review by the planning board. The planning board doesn't have the authority to reject a project, but can hold a public hearing and engage with the owners of a project on any concerns of the planning board or the public.
