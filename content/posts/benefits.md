In addition to MBTA-CA compliance, the Harvard Street proposal could provide the following benefits:
- more residents using our biggest retail corridor, meaning more customers for our local businesses
- more predictable development in line with community standards
- more affordable housing, well-integrated into our housing inventory, instead of [40B projects]( {{< ref 40b >}} ) that the town is forced to accept.
- helping the environment by adding more housing closer to public transit.
