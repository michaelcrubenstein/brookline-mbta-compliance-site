The Attorney General has stated publicly that towns that do not comply with the MBTA, in addition to losing access to state funding for public housing, will be sued by the state.

According to my conversations with the Town Counsel the following would likely occur:

In January, the lawsuit would probably be filed and Brookline would lose through a summary judgement. Brookline would be given a period of time, such as 90 days, to comply.

If Brookline still doesn't comply, compliance would be mandated by a court, either using a plan that had already been developed or according to a court-appointed body. In either case, the citizens and representatives of Brookline would lose any means of input into changes to our zoning laws.

Also, according to my conversations with the Town Counsel, the cost of defending against this lawsuit would be in the six figures.

Some town meeting members have said on the TMMA listserv that it is highly unlikely that the AG would sue us this quickly and that we would be able to negotiate a settlement.
