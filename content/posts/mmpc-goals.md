On April 18, 2023, the Select Board passed {{< rawhtml >}}<a href="https://meetings.brooklinema.gov/OnBaseAgendaOnline/Documents/ViewDocument/4-18-23%20MBTA-CA%20MULTIFAMILY%20PERMITTING%20COMMITTEE%20CHARGE.DOCX.pdf?meetingId=1543&documentType=Minutes&itemId=41716&publishId=28226&isSection=false" target="_new">a charge</a>{{< /rawhtml >}} establishing the MBTA-CA Multifamily Permitting Committee. The purpose of this committee is to identify, develop, and analyze potential options for complying with the MBTA Communities Act. The options could but need not include portions of the Harvard Street study. 

Before reporting to the Select Board on July 14th or so, the committee has several tasks to accomplish. Its primary task is to develop at least two solutions for MBTA Communities Act compliance. A goal of this task is that at least one solution would likely incentivize at least 699 net new housing units constructed (10% of the theoretical [capacity]( {{< ref "capacity-use" >}}) required by [EOHLC]({{< ref eohlc >}}) guidelines for Brookline).
