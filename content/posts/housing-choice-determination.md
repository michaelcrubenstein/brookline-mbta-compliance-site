From Voting Threshold Guidance provided by the Executive Office of Economic Development:
 
The Town Moderator has authority to “preside and regulate the proceedings, and decide 
all questions of order”—potentially including the required quantum of vote—
pursuant to G.L. c. 39, § 15.

This guidance also recommends that the planning board, in creating its report on a zoning proposal, include in this report a determination of which voting threshold applies to the zoning proposal. 

According to this guidance, the Town Moderator has the final word on whether the Housing Choice threshold applies.
