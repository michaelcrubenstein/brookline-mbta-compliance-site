The MBTA-CA Act and its Guidelines require zoning changes, not a plan to build housing. The zoning changes themselves won't add to the cost of providing town services, including schools. In general, the cost of providing services for new residents is offset by the additional property tax revenue generated by their housing.

Additional, since development based on these zoning changes will occur over several years, the town can adjust its budget based on the evolving needs of its residents, as it has always done.
