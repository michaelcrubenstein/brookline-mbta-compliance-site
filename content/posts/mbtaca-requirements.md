Because Brookline is a "rapid transit community" (i.e., it has sufficient developable land close to the Green Line B, C and D branches), the town must submit a plan to be approved by the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities ([EOHLC]( {{< ref eohlc >}} )) by December 31st, 2023.

EOHLC has published {{< rawhtml >}}<a href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/multi-family-zoning-requirement-for-mbta-communities" target="_new">final compliance guidelines</a>{{< /rawhtml >}} with which the plan Brookline submits must comply.

Because the plan will include changes to our zoning by-laws, the changes must be approved by Town Meeting at a special meeting in November 2023. Depending on the changes, the warrant article containing the changes may require a 2/3 majority to be enacted.
