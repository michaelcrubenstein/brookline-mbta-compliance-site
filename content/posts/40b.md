Chapter 40B of the Massachusetts General Law allows builders to bypass local zoning laws to create affordable housing in cities and town that do not meet a certain threshold.

For Brookline, the threshold is met when 10% of our housing is part of our Subsidized Housing Inventory maintained by the state.
