The Harvard Street zoning proposal doesn't have a production goal. 

According to analysis done by the Planning Department, approximately 800 additional units of housing **could** be built within the proposed Harvard Street zoning district on parcels currently containing 1 story retail buildings. 

Another 400 additional units of housing **could** be built if the TJ Maxx and Stop & Shop sites were redeveloped as 4 story buildings with minimal open space. Furthermore, future density bonuses could permit even more units by allowing more than four stories on parts of these sites.

A property owner considers many factors when deciding whether to redevelop a one or two story commercial building as a four story building, such as:

- What are their short- and long-term financial goals?
- Is the revenue from existing tenants lucrative?
- Could they bear the loss of revenue from existing tenants?
