The Harvard Street zoning proposal doesn't have a production goal. 

However, looking at 1 and 2 story retail building, between 800 and 1200 units of infill are available across the Harvard St Study area. The incentives to redevelop 2 story buildings are low because of the revenue lost during the construction project. Just looking at 1 story retail buildings, the number is closer to 800 units.

If you ask to property owners whether they would redevelop, some say "I might do it for 6 stories, probably not for 4" or "if I could buy the abutting lot, then it might be feasible to redevelop."
