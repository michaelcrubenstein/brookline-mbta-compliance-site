The Harvard Street zoning proposal doesn't have a production goal. 

According to analysis done by the Planning Department, approximately 800 additional units of housing **could** be built within the proposed Harvard Street zoning district on parcels currently containing 1 story retail buildings. 

Another 400 additional units of housing could be built on parcels currently containing 2 story buildings. However, the incentives to redevelop 2 story buildings are low because of the loss of revenue from two existing floors during construction.
