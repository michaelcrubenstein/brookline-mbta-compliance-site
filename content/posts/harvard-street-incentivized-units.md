The Harvard Street zoning proposal doesn't have a production goal. 

Looking at existing 1 story retail buildings on Harvard Street, approximately 800 additional units of housing **could** be built within this proposed zoning district. 

If we were to include 2 story buildings, another 400 additional units of housing could be built. However, the incentives to redevelop 2 story buildings are low because of the revenue lost during  construction.
