"Imagine a city where everything you needed could be found within a fifteen-minute walk or bike ride from your home, including fresh food, healthcare, schools, offices, shops, parks, gyms, banks, and diverse entertainment. The paths to get there are safe, tree-shaded, car-free neighborhoods where people can get to know each other." - **Regeneration** by Paul Hawkens
