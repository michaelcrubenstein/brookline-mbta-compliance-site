Most developers opt to provide parking on site to meet market demand, as Brookline has a strict on-street parking bylaw, which precludes spill over parking in the public way for residents.

The proposed zoning for Harvard Street would set a parking maximum of 1 parking space per dwelling unit. Based on parking data by census tract, 1 parking space is more than enough space to meet demand.

40B developers on Harvard Street have been granted waivers to provide 0.3 to 0.7 parking spaces per unit (none have requested no parking), which matches demand closely, according to the same parking data.
