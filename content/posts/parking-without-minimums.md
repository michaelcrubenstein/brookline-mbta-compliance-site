Even without parking minimums, most developers opt to provide parking on site to meet market demand, especially because Brookline prohibits overnight parking on the public ways.

In addition, the proposed zoning for Harvard Street would set a parking **maximum** of 1 parking space per dwelling unit. According to parking studies of Harvard Street, 1 parking space per unit is more than enough to meet demand.

Recent 40B developers on Harvard Street have been granted waivers to provide 0.3 to 0.7 parking spaces per unit, which closely matches demand according to the same parking studies. No developers have requested no parking.
