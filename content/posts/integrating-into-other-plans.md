The MBTA-CA Multifamily Permitting Committee is charged with generating a proposal and delivering its proposal to the Select Board. That proposal may include elements of the Harvard Street proposal.

It is the role of the Select Board to consider the Harvard Street zoning proposal as well as any proposal generated by the Select Board Multifamily Permitting Committee. The Select Board then must define the MBTA-CA compliant zoning district. The Select Board will direct the Planning Department to present the necessary amendments to our zoning bylaws in a warrant article for approval by the Fall Town Meeting.
