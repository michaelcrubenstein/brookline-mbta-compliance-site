      <description>&amp;ldquo;Imagine a city where everything you needed could be found within a fifteen-minute walk or bike ride from your home, including fresh food, healthcare, schools, offices, shops, parks, gyms, banks, and diverse entertainment. The paths to get there are safe, tree-shaded, car-free neighborhoods where people can get to know each other.&amp;rdquo; - Regeneration by Paul Hawkens</description>

      <title>Capacity</title>

      <description>Three definitions of capacity affect considerations of Brookline&amp;rsquo;s MBTA-CA compliance. By default, capacity is calculated assuming that one unit of housing capacity requires 1000 square feet, slightly greater than the size of a typical two-bedroom apartment.
Theoretical capacity is the number of units that could be built on a parcel if it were empty. EOHLC uses theoretical capacity to determine compliance.
Incremental capacity subtracts the floor area of what is already built from the theoretical capacity.</description>

      <description>The Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities is a cabinet level office that is charged with creating more homes in Massachusetts and lowering housing costs for residents. It was previously known as the Department of Housing and Community Development.
EOHLC enforces the MBTA-Communities Act by reviewing the plans from MBTA communities and determines whether those plans are in compliance with the MBTA-CA.
EOHLC has developed guidelines that specify what cities and towns need to do to comply with the MBTA-CA.</description>

      <title>Inclusionary Zoning</title>

      <description>Inclusionary zoning by-laws require developers to either include affordable units in their buildings or pay into a trust that develops affordable housing.
Payments made for inclusionary zoning go to the Affordable Housing Trust Fund.
In May, 2023, Town meeting passed Warrant Article 14. As a result, buildings with at least 11 housing units must include affordable housing on site.
According to state law, Brookline can&amp;rsquo;t require more than 10% of units for a building be affordable for residents at 80% of the area median income (AMI).</description>

      <guid>http://brookline-mbtaca-compliance.great-site.net/posts/the-law/multi-family-housing/</guid>
      <description>According to the MBTA-CA, “Multi-family housing” means a building with 3 or more residential dwelling units or 2 or more buildings on the same lot with more than 1 residential dwelling unit in each building.
What is the impact of requiring that Brookline create a zoning district which allows Multi-Family Housing as of right?

      <title>Overlay District</title>

      <description>An overlay district is an area of land that has zoning that can override the base zoning of the lots contained within the overlay district.
For example, if the base zoning of a certain type of district says that buildings cannot be taller than 45 feet, then overlay district zoning can allow buildings as tall as 55 feet within the overlay district.</description>

      <title>Permitting As Of Right</title>

      <guid>http://brookline-mbtaca-compliance.great-site.net/posts/permitting-by-right/</guid>
      <description>If a Zoning Bylaw says that a property can be used in a certain way &amp;ldquo;as of right&amp;rdquo;, then that means that the owner of the property doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to apply to the Zoning Board of Appeals to get a special permit to build on the property for that use.

      <description>A special permit is a permit issued by the Town Zoning Board of Appeals to allow a building to be built. The Zoning Board of Appeals has some discretion as to whether or not to issue a special permit, depending on the zoning code.</description>
