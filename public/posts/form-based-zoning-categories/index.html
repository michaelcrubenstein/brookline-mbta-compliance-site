<h3 id="schematic-massing">Schematic Massing</h3>
<p>By-laws that ensure that the mass of a building is in scale with other buildings in its neighborhood.</p>
<ul>
<li>Maximum building heights</li>
<li>Minimum or maximum floor heights</li>
<li>Step-backs from one floor to the next</li>
<li>Set-backs from the edge of lots</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="characterarchitectural-style">Character/architectural Style</h3>
<p>By-laws that ensure that the character and style of a building are coherent with other buildings in its neighborhood.</p>
<p>For example, the following could be implemented in areas where we want ground-floor retail:</p>
<ul>
<li>Require 80% transparency of the first floor</li>
<li>Require prominent cornices</li>
<li>Quality materials on the ground floor</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="quality-of-life-impact">Quality of Life Impact</h3>
<p>By-laws that ensure that a building is used in such a way that minimizes the disruption to neighbors, maximizes safety and  maintains or improves the quality of life for the surrounding community</p>
<ul>
<li>Prohibit parking from view from the public way</li>
<li>Standards for trash management in the zoning.</li>
<li>Requiring transparent building corners  so you can see around them.</li>
<li>Requiring residential entrances on side streets.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="environmental">Environmental</h3>
<p>By-laws that ensure that a building and its surrounding protect the environment of the building.</p>
<p>For example, creating a Tree By-law for North Brookline.</p>
