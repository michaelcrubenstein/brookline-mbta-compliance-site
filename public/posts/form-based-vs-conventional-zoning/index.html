			<p>Form-based zoning describes precise measurable requirements for the forms of buildings and their surrounding, whereas conventional zoning defines some measurable limits that can lead to a variety of different forms for buildings and their surroundings.</p>
<p>For example, conventional zoning might specify a Floor-Area Ratio, which can lead to buildings with dramatically different shapes (a building with one floor of 5000 square feet and a building with five floors of 1000 square feet would both have the same floor area). With form-based zoning, a building might specify a maximum building height, step-backs from one floor to the next, floor heights, roof shapes, surface requirements, landscaping requirements, etc. With greater specificity, form-based zoning leads to more predictable outcomes.</p>
