	<meta name="description" content="If a zoning by-law requires commercial use in any part of a building, that building becomes a multi-use building, not a multi-family building. Because the MBTA Community Act (MBTA-CA) requires that all lots within a compliant multi-family zoning district are permitted to build multi-family housing by right, this requirement makes the area being zoned non-compliant with the MBTA.
A zoning by-law can allow multi-use buildings as well as multi-family buildings and be compliant; the by-law cannot require multi-use or commercial building." />
