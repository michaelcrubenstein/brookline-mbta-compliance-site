			<p>In certain locations, the best economic use of the ground floor will be commercial, because owners can get higher rents from commercial leases than residential leases.
Normally, these buildings will be four stories high, and 15% of the units must be deemed affordable to lower income people.</p>
<p>However, since people with middle incomes need affordable housing as well, Brookline can incentivize middle income housing, such as units affordable to residents at 80% of the Area Median Income (AMI) alongside the purely economic incentives for ground floor commercial.</p>
<p>The 
<a href="https://www.brooklinema.gov/493/Economic-Development-Advisory-Board" target="_new">Economic Development Advisory Board</a> and the Housing Advisory Board are working on a proposal to give financial relief to developers who include commercial retail in their buildings. They are discussing it in public meetings in June, 2023. The proposal was laid out at a meeting on 
<a href="https://www.brooklinema.gov/DocumentCenter/View/41475/EDAB-0508-2023" target="_new">May 8, 2023</a>.</p>
<p>According to this proposal, if a developer provides evidence of permanent and physical investment in ground floor commercial, then they would be allowed to lift the <a href="/posts/inclusionary-zoning">inclusionary zoning</a> requirements and/or get relief from some of the strictures of the inclusionary zoning law, such as refunding a contribution to the Affordable Housing Trust Fund or raising the AMI limitation so that middle income people could lease or buy affordable units.</p>
