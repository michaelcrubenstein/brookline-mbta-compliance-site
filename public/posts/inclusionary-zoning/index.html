<p>According to state law, Brookline can&rsquo;t require more than 10% of units for a building be affordable for residents at 80% of the area median income (AMI). However, by documenting its economic feasibility of stricter inclusionary zoning town-wide, we can require stricter inclusionary zoning: 15% of units for a building must be affordable for residents at 50% AMI. As of May, 2023, we are in the process of documenting such economic feasibility.</p>
