	<meta name="description" content="Compliance with the MBTA-CA requires changes to zoning. It is not a housing production plan, so it doesn&rsquo;t automatically create any housing, affordable or not.
Since Warrant Article 14 passed, Brookline has a requirement town-wide that multi-family housing with more than 10 units will have to have 15% of their units deed affordable. Any housing created in the multi-family zoning district will have to comply with this zoning by-law.
The Select Board has established goals for the town for our MBTA compliance that include that there will be at least 699 units of housing likely to be built in the multi-family zoning district." />
