The cost of providing services for new residents is offset by the property tax revenue generated by the housing for those new residents.
Different residents of Brookline make use of different services. Senior citizens and families with school age children may have different needs, and the town can balance budgets and services as needed." />

<p>The cost of providing services for new residents is offset by the property tax revenue generated by the housing for those new residents.</p>
<p>Different residents of Brookline make use of different services. Senior citizens and families with school age children may have different needs, and the town can balance budgets and services as needed. In many cases, discrimination against certain types of residents is specifically prohibited by law. For example, zoning laws in the multi-family zoning district can not discriminate against families with children.</p>
